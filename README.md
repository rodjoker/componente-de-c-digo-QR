## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<h2>These are the tags I used for this project</h2>
  <div>
  <img>
  <h3>
  <p>

```
```css
.container-qr {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 250px;
}

### Continued development

The next step in my training is to reinforce and practice flexbox, I think it is essential to become a good front.

### Useful resources

- [Midudev](https://youtu.be/PSwlAuRbv_A?si=GxLPhuSkO25C3i89) - This is an excellent MIDUDEV video tutorial, I highly recommend it if you want to learn CSS.

### I want to thank the frontendmentor community for these challenges that help us develop our skills, midudev for his tutorials and Marcel Pernia for his mentoring...
